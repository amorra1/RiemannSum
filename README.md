<h1>Riemann Sum Calculator Program</h1>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>
Project consists of obtaining user input of a function and its bounds. The Riemann Sum with 5, 25, and 100 intervals would be calculated and displayed to the user. The Taylor Series Approximation would then be calculated with 3, 5, and 10 terms. The Taylor Series Riemann Sum combination would then be calculated with 5, 15, and 100 intervals again and outputted to the user. Fianally, the error in the Riemann Sums would be calculated. This project demonstrated knowledge and understanding of key Calculus theories and adequate use of functions within the program.
